##FAA Airport Closures
On Friday, March 22, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration released this [press release](http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=14414) describing a "decision that 149 federal contract towers will close beginning April 7 as part of the agencyâ€™s sequestration implementation plan." 

In addition to the release was a [document](http://www.faa.gov/news/media/fct_closed.pdf) listing the individual name, city, state and airport identification signs of those towers to be closed.

Working on a previous [conclusion](http://feomike.github.com/state_seq/) that perhaps there was a process worth repeating, I took the short time to open this data and make it releaseable.  


##How I Did It
I first copied the data from the pdf above, into this [text](data/faa_closed_20130322.csv).  This 'data file' is essentially one row per newly proposed closed airport by the FAA.  I saved that document to an excel file, and uploaded that file to [this google document sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aooxb2GcQ9ifdDRWOVBLUU1ocHRuNFRSUjNwVUZjYmc&usp=sharing).  I edited the columns slightly, to concatenate the columns (see column F) into a more readible place name; one that was more likely to be found by a geocoder.  I then used [this process](http://mapbox.com/blog/mapping-google-doc-spreadsheet/) to associate each row (e.g. airport) with its latitude and longitude.

The same [tool](http://mapbox.com/blog/mapping-google-doc-spreadsheet/) described above, contains a way to export this newly geocoded file to a geoJson file.  I performed that export, which is [this file](data/FAA_closed_20130322.geojson).

I then used [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) to create a simple map of these locations.


##Results

####Data
- [Data File - geojson](data/FAA_closed_20130322.geojson)
- [TileMill Map Project Fle](maps/faa_20130322.mml)

####Visualizations
- [MapBox Example Visualization](http://tiles.mapbox.com/feomike/map/map-vl7gh805#4.00/38.75/-96.61)


##Costs

####Software
- Storing the original data (Google Docs) - $0
- Exporting to geojson (Google Docs) - $0
- Visualization with map cartography (TileMill) - $5 / month
- Versioning, governance, issue tracking, history, code sharing, collaboration and general awesomeness (GitHub) - $0

####Hardware
- Hosting map tiles (MapBox) - $0
- Web hosting (GitHub) - $0

##Conclusion
The process is simple repeatable, but more importantly, the impact of the news item is much more clearly represented.  Moreover, in my (our) previous experiment, independent (new applications)[http://chelm.github.com/state_seq/examples/states.html] sprung up.  I expect the same might be true here.
